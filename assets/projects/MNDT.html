          The Mapping Natural Disasters Tweet (MNDT) project was a collaborative project for a client as part of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive.  The client wanted us to create tools that could help people on the ground of a disasters gain situational awareness. Working together, the three other collaborators and I decided that creating a proof of concept web app that maps tweets relevant to a disaster would be optimal choice given our time constraints of only three weeks. My contribution to the project was creating a web application using flask. A web app that could gather data and tweets using api, classify the tweets as either relevant or non-relevant to a disaster using machine learning and then map the relevant tweets on an interactive map.
