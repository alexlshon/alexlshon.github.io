        <p> The idea for this project came about from my previous experience when I worked as a  research intern at a nearby paper manufacturer in college. My primary job was to assist engineers, researchers and project manager in the R&D department with finding information. One of the most common requests for assistance were for any information on patents related to new product ideas. Specifically, they wanted to know which patents that are most similar in subject matter to the new product idea. In their past experience, knowing the patents, sharing the same subject matter as the new product idea, gave insights on how to avoid patent ligitagation, possible competition for the new product and opportunities for new patents. What I found most helpful in this endeavor was searching patents by subject matter classification instead of keywords.</p>

        <p> One of the main difficulties in finding patents by keyword is that various patents on the same subject matter have different keywords. Once when I was searching for patents related to water soluble paper labels for food service use, I missed out on a bunch of patents by one of the company's main Japaness rivals. I was missing out on these patents because they had water dissolving as the term to mean water soluble or  dissolvable in water. This grammatically incorrect term was probably due to the machine translation from Japanese to English. When I search by subject matter classification instead, I got both the missing Japanese patents and the patents found using keywords. This experience keyed me in to the productive value of using subject matter classification as variables in gaining insights from patent analysis. Value which piqued my interest in using patent subject matter classification as training data for machine learning patent analysis algorithms. The groundwork for and most basic example of such an algorithm would be one that could classify by subject matter  patents based on the text of the patent. </p>

        <p> Patent classification is a challenging task due to large number of possible subject matters that a patent can be classified into. This challenge is compounded by the high level of technical vocabulary and the large size of the patent document which leads to high dimensional predictor vectors. Using natural language processing and word vectorization, A model is to be generated that can correctly classify patents into their correct patent classification. The dataset of patents used is about 50 GB which adds considerable challenges in modeling due to its size. Challenges that are met using apache spark, an analytical framework that specializes in computing big data. Using apache spark, patents split into training and testing groups. Naive Bayes and cosine similarity models are fitted on the training data and transformed on the testing data. The models are then scored using accuracy. The scores from these relatively simple models are then compared to scores on more complex BERT model done in the literature. </p>
